<h1>Overview</h1>
This project is for the viewing of report data for leases, reservations, units and expenses related to the units and expense reports to determine overages.


This project will be changed into python at a later date, it is being written in ruby/rails with postgresql for the time being for the quickest release of a finished product using test data.

The python project will avoid the use of CSV files and instead use a tableau database it will pull information from.
